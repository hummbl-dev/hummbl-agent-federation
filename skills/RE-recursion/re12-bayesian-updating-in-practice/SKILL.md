# RE12 Bayesian Updating in Practice

Apply the RE12 Bayesian Updating in Practice transformation to continuously revise beliefs as new evidence arrives, weighting by reliability.

## What is RE12?

**RE12 (Bayesian Updating in Practice)** Continuously revise beliefs as new evidence arrives, weighting by reliability.

## When to Use RE12

### Ideal Situations

- Iterate toward a better solution using feedback loops
- Refine a process through repeated cycles
- Scale a pattern through repetition and standardization

### Trigger Questions

- "How can we use Bayesian Updating in Practice here?"
- "What changes if we apply RE12 to this iterating a workflow over several cycles?"
- "Which assumptions does RE12 help us surface?"

## The RE12 Process

### Step 1: Define the focus

```typescript
// Using RE12 (Bayesian Updating in Practice) - Establish the focus
const focus = "Continuously revise beliefs as new evidence arrives, weighting by reliability";
```

### Step 2: Apply the model

```typescript
// Using RE12 (Bayesian Updating in Practice) - Apply the transformation
const output = applyModel("RE12", focus);
```

### Step 3: Synthesize outcomes

```typescript
// Using RE12 (Bayesian Updating in Practice) - Capture insights and decisions
const insights = summarize(output);
```

## Practical Example

```typescript
// Using RE12 (Bayesian Updating in Practice) - Example in a iterating a workflow over several cycles
const result = applyModel("RE12", "Continuously revise beliefs as new evidence arrives, weighting by reliability" );
```

## Integration with Other Transformations

- **RE12 -> CO5**: Pair with CO5 when sequencing matters.
- **RE12 -> SY8**: Use SY8 to validate or stress-test.
- **RE12 -> IN3**: Apply IN3 to compose the output.

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Identify the context that requires RE12
- [ ] Apply the model using explicit RE12 references
- [ ] Document assumptions and outputs
- [ ] Confirm alignment with stakeholders or owners

## Common Pitfalls

- Treating the model as a checklist instead of a lens
- Skipping documentation of assumptions or rationale
- Over-applying the model without validating impact

## Best Practices

- Use explicit RE12 references in comments and docs
- Keep the output focused and actionable
- Combine with adjacent transformations when needed

## Measurement and Success

- Clearer decisions and fewer unresolved assumptions
- Faster alignment across stakeholders
- Reusable artifacts for future iterations

## Installation and Usage

### Nix Installation

```nix
{
  programs.openclaw.plugins = [
