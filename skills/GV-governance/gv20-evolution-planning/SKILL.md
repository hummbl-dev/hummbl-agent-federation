# GV20 Evolution Planning

Apply the GV20 Evolution Planning transformation to plan governance improvements over time.

## What is GV20?

**GV20 (Evolution Planning)** provides a framework for planning the evolution of governance capabilities, policies, and maturity.

## When to Use GV20

### Ideal Situations

- Quarterly governance planning
- After major incidents requiring governance improvements
- When expanding governance to new domains

### Trigger Questions

- "What should our governance look like in 6 months?"
- "How do we close these compliance gaps?"
- "What's our governance maturity roadmap?"

## The GV20 Process

### Step 1: Assess Current State

```yaml
# Using GV20 (Evolution Planning) - Assessment
current_state:
  maturity_level: 2  # 1-5 scale
  strengths:
    - strong_audit_trail
    - automated_enforcement

  gaps:
    - incomplete_benchmark_coverage
    - limited_self_improvement

  metrics_summary:
    compliance_score: 87
    policy_coverage: 92%
    mttr: 4h
```

### Step 2: Define Target State

```yaml
# Using GV20 (Evolution Planning) - Target
target_state:
  maturity_level: 4
  timeline: 12 months

  objectives:
    - full_SOC2_alignment
    - autonomous_learning_active
    - cross_domain_governance_complete

  metrics_targets:
    compliance_score: "> 95"
    policy_coverage: "100%"
    mttr: "< 2h"
```

### Step 3: Plan Phases

```yaml
# Using GV20 (Evolution Planning) - Phases
roadmap:
  phase_1:
    name: "Foundation Hardening"
    duration: Q1
    deliverables:
      - complete_GV_domain_implementation
      - full_audit_coverage
    success_criteria:
      - compliance_score: "> 90"

  phase_2:
    name: "Self-Improvement Activation"
    duration: Q2
    deliverables:
      - GV10_learning_integration_live
      - automated_policy_proposals
    success_criteria:
      - learning_proposals_per_month: "> 5"

  phase_3:
    name: "Full Autonomy"
    duration: Q3-Q4
    deliverables:
      - cross_domain_governance
      - benchmark_alignment_automated
    success_criteria:
      - maturity_level: 4
```

### Step 4: Track and Adjust

```yaml
# Using GV20 (Evolution Planning) - Tracking
tracking:
  review_schedule: monthly
  metrics:
    - progress_vs_plan
    - blockers_identified
    - risks_materialized

  adjustment:
    threshold: "> 2 weeks behind"
    process: re-plan_affected_phases
```

## Maturity Model

| Level | Name | Characteristics |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| 1 | Initial | Ad-hoc governance, minimal automation |
| 2 | Managed | Defined policies, basic enforcement |
| 3 | Defined | Comprehensive policies, consistent enforcement |
| 4 | Measured | Metrics-driven, self-improving |
| 5 | Optimizing | Fully autonomous, predictive |

## Integration with Other Transformations

- **GV9 → GV20**: Benchmark gaps inform planning
- **GV18 → GV20**: Metrics guide priorities
- **GV20 → GV1**: Plan drives policy creation
- **GV10 → GV20**: Learnings inform evolution

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Assess current governance maturity
- [ ] Define target state and timeline
- [ ] Create phased roadmap
- [ ] Set up progress tracking
- [ ] Schedule regular reviews

## Common Pitfalls

- Plans too ambitious
- No progress tracking
- Ignoring capacity constraints

## Best Practices

- Set realistic phase durations
- Track progress monthly
- Adjust plan based on learnings
