# GV-Governance Domain

The GV (Governance) domain extends the Base120 mental model framework with 20 governance-specific transformations designed for the HUMMBL G.A.S. Agent.

## Overview

GV transformations provide structured approaches to governance challenges across policy lifecycle, compliance, self-improvement, and multi-domain coordination.

## Transformations

| Code | Name | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| **GV1** | Policy Lifecycle | Creation → enforcement → retirement flow |
| **GV2** | Violation Taxonomy | Classify and categorize breaches |
| **GV3** | Escalation Mapping | Define when/how to escalate |
| **GV4** | Audit Trail Design | Structure provenance records |
| **GV5** | Compliance Scoring | Quantify governance health |
| **GV6** | Boundary Definition | Set autonomy limits precisely |
| **GV7** | Checkpoint Strategy | When/what to snapshot |
| **GV8** | Rollback Protocols | Safe reversion procedures |
| **GV9** | Benchmark Alignment | Map to external standards |
| **GV10** | Learning Integration | How insights become policy |
| **GV11** | Cross-Domain Governance | Policies spanning systems |
| **GV12** | Temporal Governance | Time-based policy rules |
| **GV13** | Exception Handling | Managed policy bypasses |
| **GV14** | Governance Inheritance | Policy hierarchy/overrides |
| **GV15** | Attestation Patterns | Proof of compliance |
| **GV16** | Drift Detection | Identify policy divergence |
| **GV17** | Remediation Flows | Fix violations systematically |
| **GV18** | Governance Metrics | KPIs for governance health |
| **GV19** | Stakeholder Mapping | Who owns/approves what |
| **GV20** | Evolution Planning | Governance roadmap design |

## Integration with Base120

GV transformations are designed to work alongside existing Base120 domains:

- **P (Perspective)** — GV inherits framing patterns from P1, P2
- **IN (Inversion)** — GV1, GV2 leverage IN1 risk inversion
- **DE (Decomposition)** — GV3, GV17 use DE1 root cause analysis
- **RE (Recursion)** — GV10, GV16 implement RE2 feedback loops
- **SY (Systems)** — GV11, GV18 apply SY8 systems thinking
- **CO (Composition)** — GV14 uses CO5 for policy composition

## Usage

```bash
# Apply a GV transformation
/apply-transformation GV5 "Assess compliance score for network policy domain"

# Use in governance workflow
/gas-status  # Uses GV5, GV16, GV18 internally
```
