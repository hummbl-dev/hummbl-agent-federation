# CO10 Pipeline Orchestration

Apply the CO10 Pipeline Orchestration transformation to coordinate sequential stages with explicit handoffs and error handling.

## What is CO10?

**CO10 (Pipeline Orchestration)** Coordinate sequential stages with explicit handoffs and error handling.

## When to Use CO10

### Ideal Situations

- Assemble components into a coherent whole
- Integrate multiple solutions into a unified approach
- Design systems that depend on clear interfaces and seams

### Trigger Questions

- "How can we use Pipeline Orchestration here?"
- "What changes if we apply CO10 to this integrating two services?"
- "Which assumptions does CO10 help us surface?"

## The CO10 Process

### Step 1: Define the focus

```typescript
// Using CO10 (Pipeline Orchestration) - Establish the focus
const focus = "Coordinate sequential stages with explicit handoffs and error handling";
```

### Step 2: Apply the model

```typescript
// Using CO10 (Pipeline Orchestration) - Apply the transformation
const output = applyModel("CO10", focus);
```

### Step 3: Synthesize outcomes

```typescript
// Using CO10 (Pipeline Orchestration) - Capture insights and decisions
const insights = summarize(output);
```

## Practical Example

```typescript
// Using CO10 (Pipeline Orchestration) - Example in a integrating two services
const result = applyModel("CO10", "Coordinate sequential stages with explicit handoffs and error handling" );
```

## Integration with Other Transformations

- **CO10 -> DE3**: Pair with DE3 when sequencing matters.
- **CO10 -> SY8**: Use SY8 to validate or stress-test.
- **CO10 -> RE2**: Apply RE2 to compose the output.

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Identify the context that requires CO10
- [ ] Apply the model using explicit CO10 references
- [ ] Document assumptions and outputs
- [ ] Confirm alignment with stakeholders or owners

## Common Pitfalls

- Treating the model as a checklist instead of a lens
- Skipping documentation of assumptions or rationale
- Over-applying the model without validating impact

## Best Practices

- Use explicit CO10 references in comments and docs
- Keep the output focused and actionable
- Combine with adjacent transformations when needed

## Measurement and Success

- Clearer decisions and fewer unresolved assumptions
- Faster alignment across stakeholders
- Reusable artifacts for future iterations

## Installation and Usage

### Nix Installation

```nix
{
  programs.openclaw.plugins = [
    { source = "github:hummbl-dev/hummbl-agent?dir=skills/CO-composition/co10-pipeline-orchestration"; }
  ];
}
```

### Manual Installation

```bash
openclaw-registry install hummbl-agent/co10-pipeline-orchestration
```

### Usage with Commands

```bash
/apply-transformation CO10 "Coordinate sequential stages with explicit handoffs and error handling"
```
