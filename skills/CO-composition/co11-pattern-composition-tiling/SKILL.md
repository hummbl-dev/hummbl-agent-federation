# CO11 Pattern Composition (Tiling)

Apply the CO11 Pattern Composition (Tiling) transformation to combine repeating elements to construct complex structures efficiently.

## What is CO11?

**CO11 (Pattern Composition (Tiling))** Combine repeating elements to construct complex structures efficiently.

## When to Use CO11

### Ideal Situations

- Assemble components into a coherent whole
- Integrate multiple solutions into a unified approach
- Design systems that depend on clear interfaces and seams

### Trigger Questions

- "How can we use Pattern Composition (Tiling) here?"
- "What changes if we apply CO11 to this integrating two services?"
- "Which assumptions does CO11 help us surface?"

## The CO11 Process

### Step 1: Define the focus

```typescript
// Using CO11 (Pattern Composition (Tiling)) - Establish the focus
const focus = "Combine repeating elements to construct complex structures efficiently";
```

### Step 2: Apply the model

```typescript
// Using CO11 (Pattern Composition (Tiling)) - Apply the transformation
const output = applyModel("CO11", focus);
```

### Step 3: Synthesize outcomes

```typescript
// Using CO11 (Pattern Composition (Tiling)) - Capture insights and decisions
const insights = summarize(output);
```

## Practical Example

```typescript
// Using CO11 (Pattern Composition (Tiling)) - Example in a integrating two services
const result = applyModel("CO11", "Combine repeating elements to construct complex structures efficiently" );
```

## Integration with Other Transformations

- **CO11 -> DE3**: Pair with DE3 when sequencing matters.
- **CO11 -> SY8**: Use SY8 to validate or stress-test.
- **CO11 -> RE2**: Apply RE2 to compose the output.

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Identify the context that requires CO11
- [ ] Apply the model using explicit CO11 references
- [ ] Document assumptions and outputs
- [ ] Confirm alignment with stakeholders or owners

## Common Pitfalls

- Treating the model as a checklist instead of a lens
- Skipping documentation of assumptions or rationale
- Over-applying the model without validating impact

## Best Practices

- Use explicit CO11 references in comments and docs
- Keep the output focused and actionable
- Combine with adjacent transformations when needed

## Measurement and Success

- Clearer decisions and fewer unresolved assumptions
- Faster alignment across stakeholders
- Reusable artifacts for future iterations

## Installation and Usage

### Nix Installation
