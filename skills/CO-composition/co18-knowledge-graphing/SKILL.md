# CO18 Knowledge Graphing

Apply the CO18 Knowledge Graphing transformation to represent information as interconnected entities and relationships.

## What is CO18?

**CO18 (Knowledge Graphing)** Represent information as interconnected entities and relationships.

## When to Use CO18

### Ideal Situations

- Assemble components into a coherent whole
- Integrate multiple solutions into a unified approach
- Design systems that depend on clear interfaces and seams

### Trigger Questions

- "How can we use Knowledge Graphing here?"
- "What changes if we apply CO18 to this integrating two services?"
- "Which assumptions does CO18 help us surface?"

## The CO18 Process

### Step 1: Define the focus

```typescript
// Using CO18 (Knowledge Graphing) - Establish the focus
const focus = "Represent information as interconnected entities and relationships";
```

### Step 2: Apply the model

```typescript
// Using CO18 (Knowledge Graphing) - Apply the transformation
const output = applyModel("CO18", focus);
```

### Step 3: Synthesize outcomes

```typescript
// Using CO18 (Knowledge Graphing) - Capture insights and decisions
const insights = summarize(output);
```

## Practical Example

```typescript
// Using CO18 (Knowledge Graphing) - Example in a integrating two services
const result = applyModel("CO18", "Represent information as interconnected entities and relationships" );
```

## Integration with Other Transformations

- **CO18 -> DE3**: Pair with DE3 when sequencing matters.
- **CO18 -> SY8**: Use SY8 to validate or stress-test.
- **CO18 -> RE2**: Apply RE2 to compose the output.

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Identify the context that requires CO18
- [ ] Apply the model using explicit CO18 references
- [ ] Document assumptions and outputs
- [ ] Confirm alignment with stakeholders or owners

## Common Pitfalls

- Treating the model as a checklist instead of a lens
- Skipping documentation of assumptions or rationale
- Over-applying the model without validating impact

## Best Practices

- Use explicit CO18 references in comments and docs
- Keep the output focused and actionable
- Combine with adjacent transformations when needed

## Measurement and Success

- Clearer decisions and fewer unresolved assumptions
- Faster alignment across stakeholders
- Reusable artifacts for future iterations

## Installation and Usage

### Nix Installation

```nix
{
  programs.openclaw.plugins = [
    { source = "github:hummbl-dev/hummbl-agent?dir=skills/CO-composition/co18-knowledge-graphing"; }
  ];
}
```

### Manual Installation

```bash
openclaw-registry install hummbl-agent/co18-knowledge-graphing
```

### Usage with Commands

```bash
/apply-transformation CO18 "Represent information as interconnected entities and relationships"
```
