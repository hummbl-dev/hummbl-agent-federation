# DE12 Constraint Isolation

Apply the DE12 Constraint Isolation transformation to identify specific limiting factor preventing performance improvement.

## What is DE12?

**DE12 (Constraint Isolation)** Identify specific limiting factor preventing performance improvement.

## When to Use DE12

### Ideal Situations

- Break a complex problem into manageable parts
- Separate concerns to isolate risk and effort
- Create modular workstreams for parallel progress

### Trigger Questions

- "How can we use Constraint Isolation here?"
- "What changes if we apply DE12 to this breaking down an implementation plan?"
- "Which assumptions does DE12 help us surface?"

## The DE12 Process

### Step 1: Define the focus

```typescript
// Using DE12 (Constraint Isolation) - Establish the focus
const focus = "Identify specific limiting factor preventing performance improvement";
```

### Step 2: Apply the model

```typescript
// Using DE12 (Constraint Isolation) - Apply the transformation
const output = applyModel("DE12", focus);
```

### Step 3: Synthesize outcomes

```typescript
// Using DE12 (Constraint Isolation) - Capture insights and decisions
const insights = summarize(output);
```

## Practical Example

```typescript
// Using DE12 (Constraint Isolation) - Example in a breaking down an implementation plan
const result = applyModel("DE12", "Identify specific limiting factor preventing performance improvement" );
```

## Integration with Other Transformations

- **DE12 -> P1**: Pair with P1 when sequencing matters.
- **DE12 -> CO5**: Use CO5 to validate or stress-test.
- **DE12 -> IN2**: Apply IN2 to compose the output.

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Identify the context that requires DE12
- [ ] Apply the model using explicit DE12 references
- [ ] Document assumptions and outputs
- [ ] Confirm alignment with stakeholders or owners

## Common Pitfalls

- Treating the model as a checklist instead of a lens
- Skipping documentation of assumptions or rationale
- Over-applying the model without validating impact

## Best Practices

- Use explicit DE12 references in comments and docs
- Keep the output focused and actionable
- Combine with adjacent transformations when needed

## Measurement and Success

- Clearer decisions and fewer unresolved assumptions
- Faster alignment across stakeholders
- Reusable artifacts for future iterations

## Installation and Usage

### Nix Installation

```nix
{
  programs.openclaw.plugins = [
    { source = "github:hummbl-dev/hummbl-agent?dir=skills/DE-decomposition/de12-constraint-isolation"; }
  ];
}
```

### Manual Installation

```bash
openclaw-registry install hummbl-agent/de12-constraint-isolation
```

### Usage with Commands

```bash
/apply-transformation DE12 "Identify specific limiting factor preventing performance improvement"
```
