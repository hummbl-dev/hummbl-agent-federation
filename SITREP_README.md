## SITREP Schema Compliance

All SITREPs in this repository follow the schema defined in `docs/sitrep-schema.md`:

- ✅ STATUS header (canonical vs non-canonical)
- ✅ SITREP-N format line
- ✅ 5 required sections (Situation, Intelligence, Operations, Assessment, Recommendations)
- ✅ Mental model applications tracked
- ✅ Concrete artifact/commit mapping
- ✅ Governance alignment

## Mental Model Framework

SITREPs leverage the Base120 mental model framework for analysis:

- **P (Perspective)** - Framing and viewpoint analysis
- **IN (Inversion)** - Risk identification and assumption testing
- **CO (Composition)** - Integration and synthesis
- **DE (Decomposition)** - Breakdown and prioritization
- **RE (Recursion)** - Iterative refinement
- **SY (Systems)** - Holistic and pattern recognition
