SITREP-1: HUMMBL-Agent - Foundation | UNCLASSIFIED | 20260130-2345Z | HUMMBL-LEAD | 5 sections

1. SITUATION
   Technical: Repository view only includes two commits; activity summary is limited to those entries.
   Business: Current focus appears to be documentation/planning updates based on commit messages.
   Team: No in-repo run logs available; only git history informs this report.
   Timeline: No schedule baseline available.

2. INTELLIGENCE
   Observations (external): None recorded in-repo for this report.
   System State: Not tracked in-repo for this report.

3. OPERATIONS
   Completed:
   - Commit 3715765: "Update skills manifest" (skills manifest updated).
   - Commit 28514bd: "Initial plan" (planning update recorded).
   In Progress: None confirmed from commit history.
   Blocked: None reported in commit history.

4. ASSESSMENT
   Successes:
   - Recent commits indicate planning and registry maintenance activity.
   Challenges:
   - Only two commits are available in the current history view; last 6 actions cannot be fully enumerated.
   Lessons:
   - Run logs or expanded history are needed for a fuller operational picture.

5. RECOMMENDATIONS
   Immediate:
   - Capture run logs in _state/runs to enable action-level SITREP summaries.
   - Preserve or expand commit history visibility before the next SITREP.
   Short Term:
   - Generate a canonical SITREP once action logs and evidence are available.
   Mental Model Applications:
   - Apply SY8 to detect patterns once additional actions are logged.
   - Apply DE3 to break down action categories in future SITREPs.
