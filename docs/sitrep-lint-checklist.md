# SITREP Lint Checklist (applying **IN2** premortem analysis)

## Governance Alignment

- [ ] No claims of learning/tracking unless explicitly implemented and governed.
- [ ] No gateway/service state claims unless tracked in-repo.
- [ ] No integration claims without executable skills.
- [ ] Base120 mental models are treated as lenses, not skills.

## Factual Anchors

- [ ] Completed items map to concrete artifacts or commits.
- [ ] Timeline claims reference an in-repo schedule baseline (or are omitted).
- [ ] Observations are marked external if out-of-repo.

## Structural Consistency

- [ ] STATUS header present (canonical vs non-canonical).
- [ ] All 5 sections present (Situation, Intelligence, Operations, Assessment, Recommendations).
- [ ] Recommendations are framed as registry entries or planning steps when no execution exists.
